            From the beginning we’ve had one goal: to empower artists to build
            effective websites for their music. It all started in 1999, with a
            single band website built by Bandzoogle's founder Chris Vinson for
            his alt-rock band, Rubberman. Grassroots promotion, plus the online
            community that the website created, helped the band get a record
            deal. In between tours, Chris worked at the record label designing
            websites for multi-platinum selling artists. To save time, he built
            a "control panel" to let artists make changes themselves. Realizing
            this could help independent bands and musicians build their own
            websites, Chris launched Bandzoogle in late 2003. As the needs of
            musicians have evolved, so has our mission to help them succeed
            online. Hired as Bandzoogle’s first support tech in 2007, Stacey
            Bedford became CEO in 2018. Named as a Billboard Digital Power
            Player in 2019, Stacey has helped expand the platform to include
            everything a musician needs to run a successful business online.
            From mobile design options, to commission-free music and merch
            sales, built-in crowdfunding, and fan subscriptions tools, now tens
            of thousands of artists from around the world use Bandzoogle to
            create beautiful websites and power their direct-to-fan marketing
            and sales.
